DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an easy way to interact with the Shutterstock, Inc.
    API <http://api.shutterstock.com>. You will need an API username and key
    from Shutterstock with the appropriate permissions in order to use this
    module.

METHODS
  new( api_username => $api_username, api_key => $api_key )
    Constructor method, requires both the "api_username" and "api_key"
    parameters be passed in.

  auth($username, $password)
    Authenticate for a specific customer account. Returns a
    WWW::Shutterstock::Customer object. If authentication fails, an
    exception is thrown (see WWW::Shutterstock::Exception and "ERRORS"
    section for more information).

  categories
    Returns a list of photo categories (useful for specifying a category_id
    when searching).

  search(%search_query)
    Perform a search. Accepts any params documented here:
    <http://api.shutterstock.com/#imagessearch>. Returns a
    WWW::Shutterstock::SearchResults object.

  image($image_id)
    Performs a lookup on a single image. Returns a WWW::Shutterstock::Image
    object (or "undef" if the image doesn't exist).

ERRORS
    In the event of an unexpected error, this module will die with a
    WWW::Shutterstock::Exception object. This object should have the
    necessary information for you to diagnose what exactly went wrong
    (including the full request and response objects that preceded the
    error).
